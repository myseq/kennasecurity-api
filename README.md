# Kenna Security REST API

This isn't the official scripts from KennaSecurity. The official Kenna Security REST API can be found at https://github.com/KennaPublicSamples/All_Samples

Here, I share some of the scripts to help manage some quick tasks using the Kenna Security RESTful API. For more information, please see: https://api.kennasecurity.com. And I do share some searching tips for references.

Note that, before you start, you have to obtain a 65 bytes API key as a token to access the KennaSecurity.
